## 👋 Hi, I’m Basak Pramanik

I’m an **entry-level Frontend Developer** building a strong foundation to grow into a **Software Engineer**.

My current strength is **frontend development**, where I focus on writing clean, responsive, and structured UI code using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I care about fundamentals and clarity more than shortcuts.

Alongside development, I actively practice **data structures and algorithms using Java** and have solved **300+ problems**, which helps me think logically and write better code.

This GitHub profile represents my **learning journey** — real practice, experiments, and steady progress.
